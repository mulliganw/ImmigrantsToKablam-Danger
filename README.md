This project combines elements of various popular strategy boardgames into one ultimate strategy game. 

The board begins as a hexagon divided into triangles per the amount of players, with their capital triangle as their starting triangle (or a chosen vertex, undecided).
The player's triangle(s) can be divided into smaller triangles with equal area, increasing defense at the cost of split troops. 
If the player splits a triangle with the capital on it, the capital can move to whichever of the two triangles the player chooses. (or vertex).

Players can attack other triangles with their troops, and move troops at the end of their turn. 
Splitting triangles requires money, gained with various structures placed on the vertices of triangles. 
Troops can be created with structures or with cards, similar to Risk.
